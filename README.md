## Hypotheses

Does a pre-video quiz prime students for more retention?

Does changing the input method for answering questions affect retention?

This breaks down into the following scenarios:
  - Just post-video quiz
  - Pre-video and post-video quiz
  - Alternate input for post-video quiz
  - Optionally we can also test the pre-video quiz with the alternate input
<br>
<br>

### Storing the inputs and testing hypothoses

  All data is currently stored in state but there is a method for each submit button.<br>
  These buttons will currently log the data to the console but we can easily  <br>
  send the data somewhere for more permanent storage.
