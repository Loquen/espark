This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Changing scenarios

In App.js we can edit the state to show the different quizes
  ```showQuiz```
  ```showPrefixSelector```
  ```showPreVideoQuiz```


## Hypotheses

Does a pre-video quiz prime students for more retention?

Does changing the input method for answering questions affect retention?

This breaks down into the following scenarios:
  - Just post-video quiz
  - Pre-video and post-video quiz
  - Post-video quiz with alternate input format
  - Optionally we can also test the pre-video quiz with the alternate input

### Storing the inputs and testing hypothoses
